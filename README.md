**Project: Rock Paper Scissors**

*Simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project curriculum.*

LIVE VERSION: https://antoniosimonetti.github.io/rockPaperScissorTOP/

This is my first HTML/CSS/JS project. 

**First stage | Game in the browser console
The benefits I got from this stage:**

- Learned how functions work with each other.
- Improved my understanding on the scopes.
- Game in the browser console

**Second stage | Game with added UI
The benefits I got from this stage:**

*-CSS-*

- Learned to use and import other Font and favicon.
- Deepened knowledge of CSS. I did little bit  of animation and I have found that my flexbox bases are ok for now.

*-JS-*

- Learned basic DOM manipulations and of elements styles through JavaScript code (setting attributes, adding/removing classes).
- Improved my understanding of JavaScript functions (scopes, calling, invoking, breaking down into smaller ones..).

**Improvements for the future:** 

- I will have to improve in several aspects, the first of all I have to use more functions to be called more times instead of rewriting them every time I need. 
- I have to learn to comment on my code better and less. I think I have commented on it too much and in general my JS code is too messy at the moment.
- I still have too much problem with git in CLI, luckly using UI on github saves me at the moment.

**Good things to look at:**

- The positive things that I bring with me from this project are different and have already been mentioned.
I thought I would have more problems with CSS and flexbox and instead they were the easiest and most fun part. 
This gives me confidence for the future of my code training.
